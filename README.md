EOS BIP39 Public/Private Key Generator

## Overview

At the time of this writing, EOS does not yet support BIP39 Mnemonic phrase for keys generation.

EOS BIP39 support is planned and upcoming, (see [here](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/3816)), for now a workaround is to:

1. Use a 12 word phrase to create Ethereum addresses
2. Convert those ETH address to EOS addresses.

The commandline node wallet.js script in this repo makes this simple and easy.

## Install

1. `git clone https://github.com/rudijs/eos-bip39-mnemonic-generator.git`
2. `cd eos-bip39-mnemonic-generator`
3. `npm install`

## Usage

Export your 12 word mnemonic phrase to an environment variable named `ETH_MNEMONIC`.

If you don't have a 12 word phrase, check out [https://iancoleman.io/bip39/](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) where you can generate one.

Example (12 word phrase generated from iancoleman.io/bip39 for this README only):

- `export ETH_MNEMONIC=ship wear gaze oven zone vicious cost cruise blur disease brief amused`

The default is set to create 10 EOS public/private keys, you can configure this with the `--count` flag.

Examples:

1. `node wallet.js`
2. `node wallet.js --count 1`
